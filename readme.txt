# IT SPA

It's the first project which I will prepare for my postgraduate studies about frontend technologies. This project was prepared using vanilla js without any js framework. For styling I used a little o bootstrap with cutom scss styling.

## How it works

Used technologies:
 1. Vanilla js without any framework
 2. scss and bootstrap for styling
 3. json server as database
 4. axios for data fetching
 5. uuid for id generating
 6. webpack and babel as a bindler and transpiler
 7. prettire and eslint for static code anlizing

Implemented solutions

 2. Treatments displayed in grid view
 3. Detail view of rooms and Treatments
 3. Cart funcionality

  - delete from cart
  - change rooms and treatments quontity
  - clear the cart
  - order function
 4. Carousel on main page
 5. Responsive views for mobiles, tablets and laptops
 6. Real time fetching data from json.server
 7. Register and login funcionality
